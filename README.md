# MyDot

As stated in the description, this is just another project for me to have fun in, as a way to practice my React/Redux, Typescript, and Electron. It's supposed to be an organizational tool of some kind, with windows that can run any which programs in a cool windowed way, but I use organizational tools so infrequently (ie. never) that I have very little idea as to what can actually go into this tool. A few ideas:

- ToDo (because who's ever done one of those before?)
- Program runner (start and stop `webpack -w` or `scss --watch` with a single button, view output);
- Postgresql tool (I need something better than Postico but don't wanna pay)
- Playground for user-composable component configuration with simple construction for custom forms
- I literally have no idea
